// Code as fast as you can! You need to double the integer and return it.

function doubleInteger(i) {
    // i will be an integer. Double it and return it.
    return i*2;
}

// everything but the *2 was already there. So this took me approx 3 seconds, most of which was moving my mouse to put the caret in the right spot
