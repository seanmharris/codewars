/*
Oh no, our Math object was "accidently" reset. Can you re-implement some of those functions?
We can assure, that only non-negative numbers are passed as arguments.
So you don't have to consider things like undefined, null, NaN, negative numbers, strings and so on.
Here is a list of functions, we need:
Math.round()
Math.ceil()
Math.floor()
*/

Math.round = function(number) {
    return number % 1 >= .5 ? Math.ceil(number) : Math.floor(number)
  };
  
  Math.ceil = function(number) {
    return number % 1 === 0 ? number : Math.floor(number) + 1;
  };
  
  Math.floor = function(number) {
    return number - number % 1;
  };
